I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology within the Nuclear Science and Engineering Department. I work broadly with radio-frequency heating and current drive systems for fusion energy devices. I am currently working on the high-field side lower hybrid current drive project at the DIII-D tokamak. This will be the first experimental verifcation of the benefits of high-field side launch of radio-frequency waves in any tokamak device.

During my Ph.D., I designed and installed a new diagnostic on DII-D, a high-field side scrape-off layer reflectometer. This diagnostic measures density profiles at the location of the newly installed high-field side lower hybrid current drive and provides key plasma density measurements to optimize and understand coupling of the RF waves into the plasma core.

I am interested in the application of scientific machine learning techniques and Bayesian-based data analysis to build optimized RF systems for fusion energy and to better understand the physics of these systems when they are deployed. See my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RwWDvX0AAAAJ&hl=en) or [CV](https://leppink.github.io/assets/pdf/Leppink_CV.pdf) for recent publications and feel free to reach out via email if you are interested in working together.

Outside of work, I enjoy cycling (follow me on Strava!), surfing with friends, and scouring whichever city I am in for the sushi with the highest quality/price ratio.
