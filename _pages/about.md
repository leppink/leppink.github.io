I am currently a Plasma & RF Engineer at Lam Research. I work on the research and development of plasma diagnostics and plasma sources for plasma-enhanced deposition processes in semiconductor manufacturing. Before Lam, I obtained my PhD from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology within the Nuclear Science and Engineering Department. 

During my Ph.D., I designed and installed a new diagnostic on the DIII-D tokamak, a high-field side scrape-off layer reflectometer. This diagnostic measures density profiles at the location of the newly installed high-field side lower hybrid current drive and provides key plasma density measurements to optimize and understand coupling of the RF waves into the plasma core.

I am interested in designing novel plasma sources in tandem with creative diagnostics for a variety of real-world applications. I am also interested in the application of scientific machine learning techniques and Bayesian-based data analysis to build optimized RF systems for fusion energy and to better understand the physics of these systems when they are deployed. See my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RwWDvX0AAAAJ&hl=en) or [CV](https://leppink.github.io/assets/pdf/Leppink_CV.pdf) for recent publications and feel free to reach out via email if you are interested in working together.

Outside of work, I enjoy cycling (follow me on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/121797180)!), hiking, skiing, and surfing with friends, or scouring whichever city I am in for the sushi with the highest quality/price ratio.
